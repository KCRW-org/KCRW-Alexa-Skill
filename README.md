KCRW Alexa Skill
================


This Alexa skill plays the KCRW FM live AAC radio music and news streams, and tells you information about the show or song that is currently playing. Requested song/show information is spoken by Alexa and also displayed as a "card" in the Alexa app or Echo Show (not yet tested).

See [voice-UX.md](./voice-UX.md) for description of voice interface and allowed commands.
